## Overview

The Book Recommendations System is designed to suggest books to users based on various recommendation algorithms. This project uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Features

- *User-based Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends books based on user similarities.
- *Item-based Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends books based on item similarities.
- *Content-based Filtering*: Recommends books based on book content (e.g., genre, author).
- *Hybrid Methods*: Combines multiple recommendation techniques for improved accuracy.
- *User Interface*: Simple web-based interface to view and rate books.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendations-system.git
    cd book-recommendations-system
    

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    

3. Install the required packages:
    sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

4. Set up the database:
    sh
    python setup_database.py
    


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation models is a combination of publicly available book datasets such as the (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset). The dataset includes book metadata, user ratings, and reviews.

## Model

The system employs several models to generate recommendations:

- *Collaborative Filtering*: Utilizes user-item interaction matrices and similarity calculations.
- *Content-based Filtering*: Uses book metadata to find similar items.
- *Hybrid Model*: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for better performance.
